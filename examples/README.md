### Example web application

Before testing this example application run Mockachu in production mode (on port 8081).
To do this please refer to [Mockachu web application README](../../src/main/webapp/README.md).

After Mockachu has started navigate to its Web UI and to the `Config` section.
In the config plain text area paste contents of the following config file [config.yml](./config.yml) and hit `Save and apply`.
Now Mockachu is ready to serve `products` API.

Now you can open this application (index.html) in a browser.
